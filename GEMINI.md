- NEVER run any build or linting commands.
- aways use the basic types for the database, int, text, bool, timestamp unless there is a really really good reason to use a different type.
- all primary ids in the db should be uuids
- where need ensure bs columns are marked with not null
- in the base directory, look for a file call fit-dd-mm-yy.md if it doesn't exist, create it. after each action please summarize what was doen in this file in a list format, this is for my viewing in my obsidian vault. make an  obsidian link to fit in it.



# Web

- Use Shadcn where possible
- Always respect the componets/ui directory, and if you need to extend any features do it in a new directory
- Shadcn is build with BaseUI, not that with base ui, there is is asChild paramater, instead you pass the element you want rendered, through the rendered patam, eg <Button render={<div />}>Button</Button>
- if data needs to be prefetched here is how
export const Route = createFileRoute('/$orgSlug/admin/s/exercises')({
	component: ExercisesTable,
	loader: async ({ context }) => {
		const session = context.session
		const userOrgId = session?.user?.organisationId

		if (!userOrgId) return <div>missing org</div>

		await context.queryClient.prefetchQuery(
			orpc.exercise.getAllOrg.queryOptions({
				input: { organisationId: userOrgId },
			}),
		)
	},
	ssr: false,
})


# Database

I am using a cutting edge beta version of drizzle that has some updates to how queries work, see the docs below

## Drizzle Docs
API changes
What is working differently from v1

One of the biggest updates were in Relations Schema definition

The first difference is that you no longer need to specify relations for each table separately in different objects and then pass them all to drizzle() along with your schema. In Relational Queries v2, you now have one dedicated place to specify all the relations for all the tables you need.

The r parameter in the callback provides comprehensive autocomplete functionality - including all tables from your schema and functions such as one, many, and through - essentially offering everything you need to specify your relations.

// relations.ts
import * as schema from "./schema"
import { defineRelations } from "drizzle-orm"

export const relations = defineRelations(schema, (r) => ({
    ...
}));

// index.ts
import { relations } from "./relations"
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/..."

const db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { relations })

What is different?

Schema Definition

One place for all your relations
❌ v1

import { relations } from "drizzle-orm/_relations";
import { users, posts } from './schema';

export const usersRelation = relations(users, ({ one, many }) => ({
  invitee: one(users, {
    fields: [users.invitedBy],
    references: [users.id],
  }),
  posts: many(posts),
}));

export const postsRelation = relations(posts, ({ one, many }) => ({
  author: one(users, {
    fields: [posts.authorId],
    references: [users.id],
  }),
}));

✅ v2

import { defineRelations } from "drizzle-orm";
import * as schema from "./schema";

export const relations = defineRelations(schema, (r) => ({
  users: {
    invitee: r.one.users({
      from: r.users.invitedBy,
      to: r.users.id,
    }),
    posts: r.many.posts(),
  },
  posts: {
    author: r.one.users({
      from: r.posts.authorId,
      to: r.users.id,
    }),
  },
}));

You can still separate it into different parts, and you can make the parts any size you want

import { defineRelations, defineRelationsPart } from 'drizzle-orm';
import * as schema from "./schema";

export const relations = defineRelations(schema, (r) => ({
  users: {
    invitee: r.one.users({
      from: r.users.invitedBy,
      to: r.users.id,
    }),
    posts: r.many.posts(),
  }
}));

export const part = defineRelationsPart(schema, (r) => ({
  posts: {
    author: r.one.users({
      from: r.posts.authorId,
      to: r.users.id,
    }),
  }
}));

and then you can provide it to the db instance

const db = drizzle(process.env.DB_URL, { relations: { ...relations, ...part } })

Define many without one

In v1, if you wanted only the many side of a relationship, you had to specify the one side on the other end, which made for a poor developer experience.

In v2, you can simply use the many side without any additional steps
❌ v1

import { relations } from "drizzle-orm/_relations";
import { users, posts } from './schema';

export const usersRelation = relations(users, ({ one, many }) => ({
  posts: many(posts),
}));

export const postsRelation = relations(posts, ({ one, many }) => ({
  author: one(users, {
    fields: [posts.authorId],
    references: [users.id],
  }),
}));

✅ v2

import { defineRelations } from "drizzle-orm";
import * as schema from "./schema";

export const relations = defineRelations(schema, (r) => ({
  users: {
    posts: r.many.posts({
      from: r.users.id,
      to: r.posts.authorId,
    }),
  },
}));

New optional option

optional: false at the type level makes the author key in the posts object required. This should be used when you are certain that this specific entity will always exist.
❌ v1

Was not supported in v1
✅ v2

import { defineRelations } from "drizzle-orm";
import * as schema from "./schema";

export const relations = defineRelations(schema, (r) => ({
  users: {
    posts: r.many.posts({
      from: r.users.id,
      to: r.posts.authorId,
      optional: false,
    }),
  },
}));

No modes in drizzle()

We found a way to use the same strategy for all MySQL dialects, so there’s no need to specify them
❌ v1

import * as schema from './schema'

const db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { mode: "planetscale", schema });
// or
const db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { mode: "default", schema });

✅ v2

import { relations } from './relations'

const db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { relations });

from and to upgrades

We’ve renamed fields to from and references to to, and we made both accept either a single value or an array
❌ v1

...
author: one(users, {
  fields: [posts.authorId],
  references: [users.id],
}),
...

✅ v2

... 
author: r.one.users({
  from: r.posts.authorId,
  to: r.users.id,
}),
...

... 
author: r.one.users({
  from: [r.posts.authorId],
  to: [r.users.id],
}),
...

relationName -> alias
❌ v1

import { relations } from "drizzle-orm/_relations";
import { users, posts } from './schema';

export const postsRelation = relations(posts, ({ one }) => ({
  author: one(users, {
    fields: [posts.authorId],
    references: [users.id],
	  relationName: "author_post",
  }),
}));

✅ v2

import { defineRelations } from "drizzle-orm";
import * as schema from "./schema";

export const relations = defineRelations(schema, (r) => ({
  posts: {
    author: r.one.users({
      from: r.posts.authorId,
      to: r.users.id,
      alias: "author_post",
    }),
  },
}));

custom types new functions

There are a few new function were added to custom types, so you can control how data is mapped on Relational Queries v2:

fromJson

forJsonSelect
✅ v2

const customBytes = customType<{
 	data: Buffer;
 	driverData: Buffer;
 	jsonData: string;
 }>({
 	dataType: () => 'bytea',
 	fromJson: (value) => {
 		return Buffer.from(value.slice(2, value.length), 'hex');
 	},
 	forJsonSelect: (identifier, sql, arrayDimensions) =>
 		sql`${identifier}::text${sql.raw('[]'.repeat(arrayDimensions ?? 0))}`,
 });

What is new?

through for many-to-many relations

Previously, you would need to query through a junction table and then map it out for every response

You don’t need to do it now!

Schema
❌ v1

export const usersRelations = relations(users, ({ many }) => ({
  usersToGroups: many(usersToGroups),
}));

export const groupsRelations = relations(groups, ({ many }) => ({
  usersToGroups: many(usersToGroups),
}));

export const usersToGroupsRelations = relations(usersToGroups, ({ one }) => ({
  group: one(groups, {
    fields: [usersToGroups.groupId],
    references: [groups.id],
  }),
  user: one(users, {
    fields: [usersToGroups.userId],
    references: [users.id],
  }),
}));

// Query example
const response = await db.query.users.findMany({
  with: {
    usersToGroups: {
      columns: {},
      with: {
        group: true,
      },
    },
  },
});

✅ v2

import * as schema from './schema';
import { defineRelations } from 'drizzle-orm';

export const relations = defineRelations(schema, (r) => ({
  users: {
    groups: r.many.groups({
      from: r.users.id.through(r.usersToGroups.userId),
      to: r.groups.id.through(r.usersToGroups.groupId),
    }),
  },
  groups: {
    participants: r.many.users(),
  },
}));

// Query example
const response = await db.query.users.findMany({
  with: {
    groups: true,
  },
});

Predefined filters
❌ v1

Was not supported in v1
✅ v2

import * as schema from './schema';
import { defineRelations } from 'drizzle-orm';

export const relations = defineRelations(schema,
  (r) => ({
    groups: {
      verifiedUsers: r.many.users({
        from: r.groups.id.through(r.usersToGroups.groupId),
        to: r.users.id.through(r.usersToGroups.userId),
        where: {
          verified: true,
        },
      }),
    },
  })
);

// Query example: get groups with all verified users
const response = await db.query.groups.findMany({
  with: {
    verifiedUsers: true,
  },
});

where is now object
❌ v1

const response = db._query.users.findMany({
  where: (users, { eq }) => eq(users.id, 1),
});

✅ v2

const response = db.query.users.findMany({
  where: {
    id: 1,
  },
});

For a complete API Reference please check our Select Filters docs

Complex filter example using RAW
orderBy is now object
❌ v1

const response = db._query.users.findMany({
  orderBy: (users, { asc }) => [asc(users.id)],
});

✅ v2

const response = db.query.users.findMany({
  orderBy: { id: "asc" },
});

Filtering by relations
❌ v1

Was not supported in v1
✅ v2

Example: Get all users whose ID>10 and who have at least one post with content starting with “M”

const usersWithPosts = await db.query.usersTable.findMany({
  where: {
    id: {
      gt: 10
    },
    posts: {
      content: {
        like: 'M%'
      }
    }
  },
});

Using offset on related objects
❌ v1

Was not supported in v1
✅ v2

await db.query.posts.findMany({
	limit: 5,
	offset: 2, // correct ✅
	with: {
		comments: {
			offset: 3, // correct ✅
			limit: 3,
		},
	},
});

How to migrate relations schema definition from v1 to v2
Option 1: Using drizzle-kit pull

In new version drizzle-kit pull supports pulling relations.ts file in a new syntax:
Step 1

pnpm drizzle-kit pull

Step 2

Transfer generated relations code from drizzle/relations.ts to the file you are using to specify your relations

 ├ 📂 drizzle
 │ ├ 📂 meta
 │ ├ 📜 migration.sql
 │ ├ 📜 relations.ts ────────┐
 │ └ 📜 schema.ts            |
 ├ 📂 src                    │ 
 │ ├ 📂 db                   │
 │ │ ├ 📜 relations.ts <─────┘
 │ │ └ 📜 schema.ts 
 │ └ 📜 index.ts         
 └ …

drizzle/relations.ts includes an import of all tables from drizzle/schema.ts, which looks like this:

import * as schema from './schema'

You may need to change this import to a file where ALL your schema tables are located.

If there are multiple schema files, you can do the following:

import * as schema1 from './schema1'
import * as schema2 from './schema2'
...

Step 3

Change drizzle database instance creation and provide relations object instead of schema
Before

import * as schema from './schema'
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/...'

const db = drizzle('<url>', { schema })

After

// should be imported from a file in Step 2
import { relations } from './relations'
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/...'

const db = drizzle('<url>', { relations })

If you had MySQL dialect, you can remove mode from drizzle() as long as it’s not needed in version 2
Manual migration

If you want to migrate manually, you can check our Drizzle Relations section for the complete API reference and examples of one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relations.
How to migrate queries from v1 to v2
Migrate where statements

You can check our Select Filters docs to see examples and a complete API reference.

With the new syntax, you can use AND, OR, NOT, and RAW, plus all the filtering operators that were previously available in Relations v1.

Examples

const response = db.query.users.findMany({
  where: {
    age: 15,
  },
});

select "users"."id" as "id", "users"."name" as "name"
from "users" 
where ("users"."age" = $1)

Migrate orderBy statements

Order by was simplified to a single object, where you specify the column and the sort direction (asc or desc)
❌ v1

const response = db._query.users.findMany({
  orderBy: (users, { asc }) => [asc(users.id)],
});

✅ v2

const response = db.query.users.findMany({
  orderBy: { id: "asc" },
});

Migrate many-to-many queries

Relational Queries v1 had a very complex way of managing many-to-many queries. You had to use junction tables to query through them explicitly, and then map those tables out, like this:

const response = await db.query.users.findMany({
  with: {
    usersToGroups: {
      columns: {},
      with: {
        group: true,
      },
    },
  },
});

After upgrading to Relational Queries v2, your many-to-many relation will look like this:

import * as schema from './schema';
import { defineRelations } from 'drizzle-orm';

export const relations = defineRelations(schema, (r) => ({
  users: {
    groups: r.many.groups({
      from: r.users.id.through(r.usersToGroups.userId),
      to: r.groups.id.through(r.usersToGroups.groupId),
    }),
  },
  groups: {
    participants: r.many.users(),
  },
}));

And when you migrate your query, it will become this:

// Query example
const response = await db.query.users.findMany({
  with: {
    groups: true,
  },
});

Partial upgrade or how to stay on RQB v1 even after an upgrade?

We’ve made an upgrade in a way, that all previous queries and relations definitions are still available for you. In this case you can migrate your codebase query by query without a need for a huge refactoring
Step 1: Change relations import

To define relations using Relational Queries v1, you would need to import it from drizzle-orm
v1

import { relations } from 'drizzle-orm';

In Relational Queries v2 we moved it to drizzle-orm/_relations to give you some time for a migration
v2

import { relations } from "drizzle-orm/_relations";

Step 2: Replace your queries to ._query

To use Relational Queries v1 you had to write db.query.
v1

await db.query.users.findMany();

In Relational Queries v2, we moved it to db._query so that db.query could be used for a new syntax, while still giving you the option to use the old syntax via db._query.

We had a long discussion about whether we should just deprecate db.query and replace it with something like db.query2 or db.queryV2. In the end, we decided that all new APIs should remain as simple as db.query, and that requiring you to replace all of your queries with db._query if you want to keep using the old syntax is preferable to forcing everyone in the future to use db.queryV2, db.queryV3, db.queryV4, etc.
v2

// Using RQBv1
await db._query.users.findMany();

// Using RQBv2
await db.query.users.findMany();
